I had a slow day the other day and decided to continue my tinkering with Golang and Serverless architecture.  I rather quickly banged out [Activity Ideas Now](https://www.activityideasnow.com/).

On the infrastructure side, I went with AWS Lambda and an S3 bucket to keep things lightweight and scalable. CloudFront is in the mix to handle SSL.  I started off hoping to do it all in AWS, including Route53 for the DNS.  However, AWS makes the process of adding an SSL certificate incredibly complicated.  I started using a cloudfront distribution but there were propagation issues and eventually I said screw it and took the free and easy way out.

For the frontend I kept is incredibly simple with just jQuery/HTML/CSS.  I almost just used vanilla JS and I still may rewrite it.  However, quickly prototyping was the name of the game here.  It's a simple 5 input form.  Those inputs get fed via AJAX to the lambda function.  

On the Go side, I borrowed heavily from my previous work at [Fun wigh Go and AI](https://jonathonklem.com/fun-with-go-and-ai/) and took those inputs and fed it to ChatGPT.  From there I just had to make sure to be explicity with my instructions and require ChatGPT to give the responses in JSON format.  

The end result proved to be surprisingly useful.  My wife and I have been using it to brainstorm activities.  Because of the nature of ChatGPT it's never 100% accurate on the timing, but it alerted us to a scavenger hunt at our local library this month and has inspired us to check out some local parks we have not yet visited.
