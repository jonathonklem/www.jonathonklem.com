I was helping a client on a project that involved syncing nzbs between usenet networks.  There were open source solutions that did this on a smaller scale, but he wanted to have several terabytes of mirroring happening 24/7.

One issue was trying to daemonize these already available services.  They all leveraged go's concurrency to great success but invariably there would be lots of hiccups after it was running for a while. 

The NNTP protocol itself is not very complicated, so I figured I could take a crack at it.  The challenging part was managing multiple channels to facilitate the network communication.  With NNTP and most other protocols, there's a lot of overhead in negotiating the connection.  So it makes sense to want to keep a connection open and use it to send multiple usenet articles since they're typically small in size.

The average communication looked like this (< = incoming, > = outgoing):
```
< 200 news.example.com NNTP Service Ready
> AUTHINFO USER [username]
< 381 More authentication required
> AUTHINFO PASS [password]
< 281 Authentication accepted
> POST
< 340 Send article to be posted. End with <CR-LF>.<CR-LF>
> [headers]\r\n\r\n[content]\r\n.\r\n
< 240 Article received OK
```

Pretty simple.  To avoid multiple open connections and more authentication, you can follow up with another `POST` and repeat the process.  Because I have been on a pretty big go kick and I really wanted to make the async communication work, I dove deep into configuring channels and trying to structure things in the proper way, however, it became difficult to debug and maintain because I was handling 2 different connections and acting as a middleman between the two.  One from the 'supplier' of the actual articles and the other was the recipient. 

There was complexity stacking with this because we had observed some inconsistencies with the network connections, the server responses, and even the contents of the nzb files.  Add in the problem of trying to make sexy Go concurrency work properly and it was proving to be too much.

In the end, I capitulated and just used a more serial approach.  I would have a set of functions that would open a connection with the supplier and the recipient and loop through a directory of nzb files.  It would then check to see if the supplier had said data, if so, it would fetch from supplier and repost to the recipient and just loop through that.

I was able to boost the performance by running multiple instances of the program, so effectively still having concurrent uploads but just not managed in the same executable.  This proved to be just as fast as when the concurrent application decided to run but it was sigificantly more maintainable and consistent.  We no longer had to worry about chasing down obscure conditions that caused the program to hang.
